# Yeoman Pebble Watchface

This is the first watchface that I made for the Pebble Time watch.  Nothing fancy, just to get my feet wet in how to build and deploy an app to the Pebble watch that I got today.

The design is a nod to the great scaffolding tool for web apps called [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).  Check it out!

Here's a screenshot:

Configuration is available in the app for BackgroundColor and TextColor.  Any of the 64 available colors can be used for each setting.
